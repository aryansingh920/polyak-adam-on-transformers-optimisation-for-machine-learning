## Step 1: Install Requirements

First, install all necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 2: Run the Code

You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Interactive (Notebook)
Run the `final_new.ipynb` notebook if you want to execute and control the flow **cell by cell**.

### Option 2: Full Script (Python file)
Run the `final_new.py` file if you want to execute the **entire project in one shot**:

```bash
python final_new.py
```

## Notes
- The code automatically detects and uses available GPU acceleration (MPS, CUDA, etc.).
- Training metrics and logs will be saved to `experiment_metrics.log`.
- Models and evaluation results will be saved as defined in the codebase.
